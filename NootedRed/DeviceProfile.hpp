// A single source of truth for per-device graphics and media capabilities.
//
// This is the hardware half of the compatibility model described in docs/Compatibility-Architecture.md:
// the other half is the identity of the Apple binary being patched.  A profile answers "what can this APU
// do" (graphics policy, media policy, validation level); it deliberately does not contain patch bytes or
// per macOS build data, so adding an APU never duplicates patch data and adding a macOS build never
// duplicates hardware facts.
//
// Graphics uses this profile to decide whether the Chromium dual-quad policy should be installed.
// Media describes the VCN/UVD/VDA capabilities of the device (generation, firmware, ring sizes, decode
// formats).  Engine enablement flags stay false unless the profile is hardware-validated, so populating
// the media data does not change behaviour or require a second device-selection path.
